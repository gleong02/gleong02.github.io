            <p>
                I'm Gio, a sophomore (soon to be junior) at Tufts University from Hong Kong. I'm currently pursuing a double major in engineering psychology
                and computer science. I recently declared my major after being undecided for almost 3 semesters. In fact, I heard of engineering psychology
                for the first time just this year. I am super exicted to see where my majors will take me and the fun opportunities it might bring.

                I like to intertwine my work with my multitude of interests. Beyond my two majors, I have an interest for photography, automobiles, and aviation, as well as all things
                basketball. Feel free to reach out :)
